Please refer to the article for a detailed description of the data, its origin, specificities, and limitations. 
A description of the variables contained in the dataset is available in Table A2.

Version 1.1 contains the following fixes and improvements compared to version 1.0:

- We lowered work visa costs of Mexicans coming to the US from USD 190 to 160 due to NAFTA 
  (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/employment/visas-canadian-mexican-nafta-professional-workers.html) 
- We set work and student visa costs to 0 for Canadians coming to the US due to this special agreement 
  that was previously missed: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/citizens-of-canada-and-bermuda.html 
  (we decided to not do the same for Bermuda since the exemption is only for stays <180 days and student and work stays usually take more time)
- We filled remaining data gaps for the following receiving countries: All 26 Schengen member states, 
  Australia, Belarus, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burundi, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Ireland, 
  Ivory Coast, Japan, Jordan, Libya, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia, New Zealand, Peru, Romania, Russia, Senegal, 
  Singapore, Tunisia, UK, United Arab Emirates, Yemen.
- The new variable "updated" is 1 for all cases where changes were made compared to version 1.0, and 0 otherwise
